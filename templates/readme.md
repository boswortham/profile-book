# Readme

## mypage.json

This defines strictly necessary data for each profile book. IDs are a restricted number set starting at 1000.

## questions.md

This is an explainer file for how each question object operates. Each object will be granted an ID upon creation, which, in a future version, will allow the creator of the profile book to rearrange elements.

## Miscellaneous

After a basic proof of concept is created, users will be able to construct their own questions via a separate process. For that reason, these templates describe well-defined parameters which can theoretically be changed in the future. (If I was not planning on allowing users to create their own questions, I could hard-code question data as I did in my previous quiz project.)
